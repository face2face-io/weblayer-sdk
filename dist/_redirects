# Cloudflare Pages redirects file
# This allows /org_id paths to serve the SDK file
# The SDK will auto-extract org_id from the URL

# Serve SDK for any path that doesn't have a file extension
# This matches paths like /org123, /abc123, etc.
# The actual file /weblayer-sdk.min.js will still be served directly
